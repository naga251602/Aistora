# DataBridge AI

DataBridge AI is an upcoming full-stack intelligent data exploration tool connecting structured CSV data to AI-driven conversational analysis.

This setup is the **base environment** — containing Flask, React, Docker, and CI pipelines.  
Upcoming releases (alpha, beta, v1) will integrate a custom DataFrame engine and AI chat features.

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial clean Flask + React setup"
